      <description>Central tendency is &amp;quot;the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution&amp;quot;. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire dataset. It is the single value that is most representative of the dataset.
The mean, median and mode are the three commonly used measures of central tendency.
 Mode: is a value/range that occurred with the highest frequency. Median: is the number that lies in the middle of a list of ordered numbers.</description>
