      <description>Central tendency is &amp;quot;the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution&amp;quot;. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire dataset. It is the single value that is most representative of the dataset.
The mean, median and mode are the three commonly used measures of central tendency.
 Mode: is a value/range that occurred with the highest frequency. Median: is the number that lies in the middle of a list of ordered numbers.</description>

      <description>Observing the distribution and their characteristics have particular importance in statistics. Distributions describes
  the data central tendency behaviour dispersion identify clusters, peaks and gaps   Normal Distribution The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian or standard normal distribution, is the distribution that all of its values in a symmetrical fashion, and most of the results are situated around the distribution mean.
Normally distribution is perfectly symmetric around its mean.</description>

      <description>1: Linear regression - Introduction&amp;#182;     A simple linear function&amp;#182;To understand Machine Learning concepts , consider a simple linear function of x as below:
$ y = f(x) $ &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) ... simple linear function
$ x $ = Input variable / Feature $ y $ = Output variable / Target variable
    Supervised Machine Learning algorithms outputs a hypothesis, which maps x to y.</description>

      <description>Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers.
In effect, Kurtosis explains whether the samples concentrate too much at the centre or not.
A kurtosis value near 0 indicates that the data follow the normal distribution.</description>

      <description>Measures of variability describe the amount of variability or spread in the data. The most common measures of variability are the range, the interquartile range (IQR), variance, and standard deviation.
Range The range is a measure of the total spread of values in a quantitative dataset. Unlike other more popular measures of dispersion, the range actually measures total dispersion, more literally, as the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a dataset.</description>

      <description>Correlation is
 &amp;quot; the degree of association between two variables&amp;quot; &amp;quot; the measure of the strength of association among the different variables.&amp;quot;
 Correlation does NOT
 &amp;quot; imply causation&amp;quot;
 To emphasize that a correlation between two variables does not imply that one causes the other. For example; Sales of personal computers and athletic shoes have both risen strongly in the last several years and there is a high correlation between them, but you cannot assume that buying computers causes people to buy athletic shoes (or vice versa).</description>
