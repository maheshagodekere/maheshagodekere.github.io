      <description>Central tendency is &amp;quot;the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution&amp;quot;. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire dataset. It is the single value that is most representative of the dataset.
The mean, median and mode are the three commonly used measures of central tendency.
 Mode: is a value/range that occurred with the highest frequency. Median: is the number that lies in the middle of a list of ordered numbers.</description>

      <description>Correlation is
 &amp;quot; the degree of association between two variables&amp;quot; &amp;quot; the measure of the strength of association among the different variables.&amp;quot;
 Correlation does NOT
 &amp;quot; imply causation&amp;quot;
 To emphasize that a correlation between two variables does not imply that one causes the other. For example; Sales of personal computers and athletic shoes have both risen strongly in the last several years and there is a high correlation between them, but you cannot assume that buying computers causes people to buy athletic shoes (or vice versa).</description>
