      <description>Observing the distribution and their characteristics have particular importance in statistics. Distributions describes
  the data central tendency behaviour dispersion identify clusters, peaks and gaps   Normal Distribution The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian or standard normal distribution, is the distribution that all of its values in a symmetrical fashion, and most of the results are situated around the distribution mean.
Normally distribution is perfectly symmetric around its mean.</description>

      <description>Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers.
In effect, Kurtosis explains whether the samples concentrate too much at the centre or not.
A kurtosis value near 0 indicates that the data follow the normal distribution.</description>
