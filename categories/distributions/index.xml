      <description>Observing the distribution and their characteristics have particular importance in statistics. Distributions describes
  the data central tendency behaviour dispersion identify clusters, peaks and gaps   Normal Distribution The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian or standard normal distribution, is the distribution that all of its values in a symmetrical fashion, and most of the results are situated around the distribution mean.
Normally distribution is perfectly symmetric around its mean.</description>

      <description>Kurtosis explains how the peak and tail of the distribution is in comparison with Normal distribution. Flat distributions have low kurtosis and highly peaked distribution such as the Cauchy distribution has high kurtosis value.
In effect, Kurtosis explains whether the samples concentrate too much at the centre or not.
A kurtosis value near 0 indicates that the data follow the normal distribution.
If negative kurtosis, then the distribution has light tails.</description>
