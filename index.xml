      <description>Central tendency is &amp;quot;the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution&amp;quot;. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire dataset. It is the single value that is most representative of the dataset.
The mean, median and mode are the three commonly used measures of central tendency.
 Mode: is a value/range that occurred with the highest frequency. Median: is the number that lies in the middle of a list of ordered numbers.</description>

      <description>Normal Distribution The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian or standard normal distribution, is the distribution that all of its values in a symmetrical fashion, and most of the results are situated around the distribution mean.
Normally distribution is perfectly symmetric around its mean. Since the normally distribution is symmetric around its mean, the measures of central tendency, Mode, Median and Mean have the following relationship.
 mode = median = mean</description>

      <description>Correlation is
 &amp;quot; the degree of association between two variables&amp;quot; &amp;quot; the measure of the strength of association among the different variables.&amp;quot;
 Correlation does NOT
 &amp;quot; imply causation&amp;quot;
 To emphasize that a correlation between two variables does not imply that one causes the other. For example; Sales of personal computers and athletic shoes have both risen strongly in the last several years and there is a high correlation between them, but you cannot assume that buying computers causes people to buy athletic shoes (or vice versa).</description>

      <description>1. Overview Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful class of models used for nonlinear regression and classification tasks inspired by biological neural computation. Significance of this notes is to give the clarity and completeness on the Neural Network Learning process and mathematics behind it!
2. Neural Network Learning Neural Network consist of input, hidden, or output layers. There is only one input layer and one output layer but the number of hidden layers is unlimited.</description>

      <description>The market for Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies is flourishing. Artificial intelligence is rapidly coming of age, survived the hype and poised to transform businesses and industries globally.
Gartner says AI technologies will be in almost every new software product by 2020. Billions of dollars are invested in new AI developments. IDC estimated that the AI market will grow from $8 billion in 2016 to more than $47 billion in 2020.</description>

      <description>1. Overview Decision Tree a supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification or regression predictive modeling but mostly used in classification problems. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees. The representation for the CART model is a binary tree.
2. Intuition A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.</description>
