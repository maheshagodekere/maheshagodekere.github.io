      <description>Central tendency is &amp;quot;the statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire distribution&amp;quot;. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire dataset. It is the single value that is most representative of the dataset.
The mean, median and mode are the three commonly used measures of central tendency.
 Mode: is a value/range that occurred with the highest frequency. Median: is the number that lies in the middle of a list of ordered numbers.</description>

      <description>Correlation is
 &amp;quot; the degree of association between two variables&amp;quot; &amp;quot; the measure of the strength of association among the different variables.&amp;quot;
 Correlation does NOT
 &amp;quot; imply causation&amp;quot;
 To emphasize that a correlation between two variables does not imply that one causes the other. For example; Sales of personal computers and athletic shoes have both risen strongly in the last several years and there is a high correlation between them, but you cannot assume that buying computers causes people to buy athletic shoes (or vice versa).</description>

      <description>1. Overview Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful class of models used for nonlinear regression and classification tasks inspired by biological neural computation. Significance of this notes is to give the clarity and completeness on the Neural Network Learning process and mathematics behind it!
2. Neural Network Learning Neural Network consist of input, hidden, or output layers. There is only one input layer and one output layer but the number of hidden layers is unlimited.</description>

      <description>1. Overview Decision Tree a supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification or regression predictive modeling but mostly used in classification problems. Classically, this algorithm is referred to as decision trees. The representation for the CART model is a binary tree.
2. Intuition A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.</description>
