## Normal Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the **Gaussian or standard normal distribution**, is the  distribution
that all of its values in a symmetrical fashion, and most of the results are situated around the distribution mean.

Normally distribution is perfectly symmetric around its mean. Since the normally distribution is symmetric around
its mean, the measures of central tendency, **Mode, Median** and **Mean** have the following relationship.

> mode = median = mean



## 1. Mode

<span >Mode is a value/range that occurred with the highest frequency.</span>

### Mode Characteristics

> a. Uniform Distribution: NO MODE.

> b. Distribution can have two modes like in "Foot Size" distribution for Men and Women has TWO modes, one
for Men  "Foot Size" and another for women. The distribution is a bimodal distribution.

> c. Modes can be used to describe both catagorical and numerical data.

> d. <space>All scores in the dataset DOESNOT affect the mode<span>. In the sense, if a new outliner value is added to the dataset, there
is no influence on the mode value of the dataset.

> e. Samples from the population WILL have DIFFERENT modes or NO mode depending on the sample values.

> f. There is NO equation for the mode.

<br/>
## 2. Median

<span>Number that lies in the **middle of a list of ordered numbers**. The numbers may be in
the ascending or descending order such that there is an equal probability of falling above or below it. Simply put,
it is the middle value in the list of numbers.</span>

For **even** samples :  $$ \begin{equation}  Median =  \frac{X_\frac{n}{2}+ X_{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2}\end{equation} $$
> 'X' is the sample in sample space </br>
> 'n' is the number of samples in sample space

For **odd** samples :  $$ \begin{equation}  Median =   X_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\end{equation} $$
> 'X' is the sample in sample space </br>
> 'n' is the number of samples in sample space


### Median Characteristics

> a. <space >All scores in the dataset DOES NOT affect the median. In the sense, if a new outliner value
is added to the dataset, effectively there is NO change in the **median** value of the dataset.</span>

> b. <space >The **Median** is **robust** in representing the the central/middle of the
sample/population space. This is because outliners will have very **less effect on median** .</span>

> c. Samples from the population WILL have DIFFERENT medians as **middle of a list of ordered numbers** might vary between
sample spaces of a population.


<br/>
## 3. Mean

<span >Arithmetic average of a range of values or quantities.</span>

Sample space Mean:  $$ \begin{equation}  \bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\end{equation} $$
> 'n' is the number of samples in sample space </br>
> $$ \begin{equation}  x_i\end{equation} $$ is the ith sample space value

Population Mean: $$ \begin{equation}  \mu=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\end{equation} $$
> 'N' is the number of samples in population space </br>
> $$ \begin{equation}  x_i\end{equation} $$ is the ith population space value

### Mean Characteristics

> a. <space >All scores in the dataset DOES affect the mode. In the sense, if a new outliner value
is added to the dataset, effectively there is a change in the **mean** value of the dataset.</span>

> b. Mean of the sample can be used  to make inferences about the population it came from.

> c. <space >The **Mean** can be misleading if the datasets has **outliners**. This is because
outliners creates skewed distribution by pulling the mean towards outliners. This makes the mean lot less
representative of middle of the data.</span>

> d. Samples from the population WILL have SIMILAR means (exception to outliners as explained in **c** above).

## Summary

 Central Tendency|Equation?| Changes with Sample values| Affected by bin size?|Affected by outliners?|Easy to find on histogram |
--------        |-------- |-------------------------- |---------------------  |--------------------- |--------------------- |
Mean            | Yes     | Yes                       | No                    | Yes                  |  No       |
Median          | Yes     | No                  | No                    | No                  |   No   |
Mode            | No      | No                  | Yes                   | No                  |   Yes  |
